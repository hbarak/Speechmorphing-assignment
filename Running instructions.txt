Used 'System.Web.Script.Serialization' for extracting json strings.

In order to start running application via visualStudio, put json1.json and json2.json in file (json1 & json2 from example are already in, replace them).

Dff will be shown via Console.
Click and key to exit program.

* Due to lack of time, a compiled and more user-oriented program is not presented.
Thank you.
